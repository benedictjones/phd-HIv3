# phd-HIv3
The software used to control the Hardware Interface, consisting of a Raspberry Pi used to control the HIv3 Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to apply and read voltages to a nanomaterial.
This enables fast and easy controls to perform Evolution in-Materio [1].
Evolutionary Algorithms [2] are used by optimising external stimuli to make some conductive nanomaterial do a task (e.g., classififcation)!


## PCB

The printed circuit board can be seen below.
Further information such as the circuit schematic and BOm can be found in the PCB_Design folder.
